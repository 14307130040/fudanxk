> The program will start a `goroutine` for each course specified in the command line arguments, which will exit only after all goroutines return. A goroutine will return only if the course is selected successfully. No further error handle is provided now. Be careful with the course your want to select. You can press `ctrl C`  to force terminate the fudanxk process.

In your terminal
```sh
$ source ./setenv.sh
$ ./fudanxk PTSS110061.02 COURSECODE2 COURSECODE3
